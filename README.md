RNG Evaluator
RNG Evaluator is an under-development application designed to discern whether a given number sequence is the product of a Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) or a Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG). This innovative tool will assist researchers and enthusiasts in unraveling the complexities of random number generation.

Inspiration
The driving force behind this project is the pioneering work of Polish physicist Artur Ekert, who unveiled the potential of generating random numbers rooted in quantum physics. His groundbreaking research has opened new frontiers in the field of random number generation, which RNG Evaluator aims to explore.

Testing Methodology
The application employs a suite of well-known statistical tests to examine the properties of a number sequence. These include:

Uniformity Test: Ensures that all numbers in the sequence appear with equal probability.

Autocorrelation Test: Identifies if there is any correlation between consecutive numbers in the sequence.

Runs Test: Examines the count of runs or uninterrupted sequences of identical bits.

Serial Test: Checks the frequency of all possible overlapping substrings of a certain length. (not working well yet)

Gap Test: Assesses the distribution of gaps, i.e., the length of sequences between appearances of a specific digit.

Permutation Test: Determines whether the permutations of the sequence are randomly distributed.

Maurer's Universal Test: A comprehensive test used for examining long sequences of data. (not working well yet)

Get Involved
As this project is in its early stages, so I`am open to suggestions and collaborative work. If you're intrigued by the possibilities of quantum physics and random number generation, or if you just have a knack for statistics, we would love to hear from you!
